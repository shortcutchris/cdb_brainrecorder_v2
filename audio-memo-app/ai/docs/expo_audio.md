# Audio (expo-audio)

_A library that provides an API to implement audio playback and recording in apps._

Available on platforms android, ios, web, tvos

`expo-audio` is a cross-platform audio library for accessing the native audio capabilities of the device.

Note that audio automatically stops if headphones/bluetooth audio devices are disconnected.

## Installation

```bash
$ npx expo install expo-audio
```

If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install `expo` in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-audio` using its built-in [config plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use EAS Build, then you'll need to manually configure the package.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties
| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | Only for: ios. A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message. |

## Usage

### Playing sounds

```jsx
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

const audioSource = require('./assets/Hello.mp3');

export default function App() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(audioSource);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Play Sound" onPress={() => player.play()} />
      <Button
        title="Replay Sound"
        onPress={() => {
          player.seekTo(0);
          player.play();
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

> **Info** **Note:** If you're migrating from [`expo-av`](av.mdx), you'll notice that `expo-audio` doesn't automatically reset the playback position when audio finishes. After [`play()`](#play), the player stays paused at the end of the sound. To play it again, call [`seekTo(seconds)`](#seektoseconds) to reset the position â€” as shown in the example above.

### Recording sounds

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import {
  useAudioRecorder,
  AudioModule,
  RecordingPresets,
  setAudioModeAsync,
  useAudioRecorderState,
} from 'expo-audio';

export default function App() {
  const audioRecorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
  const recorderState = useAudioRecorderState(audioRecorder);

  const record = async () => {
    await audioRecorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
    audioRecorder.record();
  };

  const stopRecording = async () => {
    // The recording will be available on `audioRecorder.uri`.
    await audioRecorder.stop();
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const status = await AudioModule.requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      if (!status.granted) {
        Alert.alert('Permission to access microphone was denied');
      }

      setAudioModeAsync({
        playsInSilentMode: true,
        allowsRecording: true,
      });
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button
        title={recorderState.isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'}
        onPress={recorderState.isRecording ? stopRecording : record}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Playing or recording audio in background&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

On iOS, audio playback and recording in background is only available in standalone apps, and it requires some extra configuration.
On iOS, each background feature requires a special key in `UIBackgroundModes` array in your **Info.plist** file.
In standalone apps this array is empty by default, so to use background features you will need to add appropriate keys to your **app.json** configuration.

See an example of **app.json** that enables audio playback in background:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "ios": {
      ...
      "infoPlist": {
        ...
        "UIBackgroundModes": [
          "audio"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using the AudioPlayer directly

In most cases, the [`useAudioPlayer`](#useaudioplayersource-options) hook should be used to create a `AudioPlayer` instance. It manages the player's lifecycle and ensures that it is properly disposed of when the component is unmounted. However, in some advanced use cases, it might be necessary to create a `AudioPlayer` that does not get automatically destroyed when the component is unmounted.
In those cases, the `AudioPlayer` can be created using the [`createAudioPlayer`](#audiocreateaudioplayersource-updateinterval) function. You need to be aware of the risks that come with this approach, as it is your responsibility to call the [`release()`](../sdk/expo/#release) method when the player is no longer needed. If not handled properly, this approach may lead to memory leaks.

```tsx
import { createAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';
const player = createAudioPlayer(audioSource);
```

### Notes on web usage

- A MediaRecorder issue on Chrome produces WebM files missing the duration metadata. [See the open Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=642012).
- MediaRecorder encoding options and other configurations are inconsistent across browsers, utilizing a Polyfill such as [kbumsik/opus-media-recorder](https://github.com/kbumsik/opus-media-recorder) or [ai/audio-recorder-polyfill](https://github.com/ai/audio-recorder-polyfill) in your application will improve your experience. Any options passed to `prepareToRecordAsync` will be passed directly to the MediaRecorder API and as such the polyfill.
- Web browsers require sites to be served securely for them to listen to a mic. See [MediaDevices `getUserMedia()` security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#security) for more details.

    return (
      <Button title="Play" onPress={() => player.play()} />
    );
  }
  ```

#### useAudioPlayerStatus (*Function*)
- `useAudioPlayerStatus(player: AudioPlayer): AudioStatus`
  Hook that provides real-time playback status updates for an `AudioPlayer`.

  This hook automatically subscribes to playback status changes and returns the current status.

    const player = useAudioPlayer(require('./sound.mp3'));
    const status = useAudioPlayerStatus(player);

    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Playing: {status.playing ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
        <Text>Current Time: {status.currentTime}s</Text>
        <Text>Duration: {status.duration}s</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
  ```

#### useAudioRecorder (*Function*)
- `useAudioRecorder(options: RecordingOptions, statusListener?: (status: RecordingStatus) => void): AudioRecorder`
  Hook that creates an `AudioRecorder` instance for recording audio.

  This hook manages the recorder's lifecycle and ensures it's properly disposed when no longer needed.
  The recorder is automatically prepared with the provided options and can be used to record audio.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `options` | RecordingOptions | Recording configuration options including format, quality, sample rate, etc. |
  | `statusListener` *(optional)* | (status: RecordingStatus) => void | Optional callback function that receives recording status updates. |

    );
  }
  ```

### Audio Methods

#### createAudioPlayer (*Function*)
- `createAudioPlayer(source: AudioSource, options: AudioPlayerOptions): AudioPlayer`
  Creates an instance of an `AudioPlayer` that doesn't release automatically.

  > **info** For most use cases you should use the [`useAudioPlayer`](#useaudioplayer) hook instead.
  > See the [Using the `AudioPlayer` directly](#using-the-audioplayer-directly) section for more details.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `source` | AudioSource | The audio source to load. |
  | `options` | AudioPlayerOptions | Audio player configuration options. |

#### getRecordingPermissionsAsync (*Function*)
- `getRecordingPermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>`
  Checks the current status of recording permissions without requesting them.

  This function returns the current permission status for microphone access
  without triggering a permission request dialog. Use this to check permissions
  before deciding whether to call `requestRecordingPermissionsAsync()`.
  Returns: A Promise that resolves to a `PermissionResponse` object containing the current permission status.
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { getRecordingPermissionsAsync, requestRecordingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-audio';

  const ensureRecordingPermissions = async () => {
    const { status } = await getRecordingPermissionsAsync();

    if (status !== 'granted') {
      // Permission not granted, request it
      const { granted } = await requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      return granted;
    }

    return true; // Already granted
  };
  ```

#### requestRecordingPermissionsAsync (*Function*)
- `requestRecordingPermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>`
  Requests permission to record audio from the microphone.

  This function prompts the user for microphone access permission, which is required
  for audio recording functionality. On iOS, this will show the system permission dialog.
  On Android, this requests the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission.
  Returns: A Promise that resolves to a `PermissionResponse` object containing the permission status.
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { requestRecordingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-audio';

  const checkPermissions = async () => {
    const { status, granted } = await requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();

    if (granted) {
      console.log('Recording permission granted');
    } else {
      console.log('Recording permission denied:', status);
    }
  };
  ```

#### setAudioModeAsync (*Function*)
- `setAudioModeAsync(mode: Partial<AudioMode>): Promise<void>`
  Configures the global audio behavior and session settings.

  This function allows you to control how your app's audio interacts with other apps,
  background playback behavior, audio routing, and interruption handling.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `mode` | Partial<AudioMode> | Partial audio mode configuration object. Only specified properties will be updated. |
  Returns: A Promise that resolves when the audio mode has been applied.
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { setAudioModeAsync } from 'expo-audio';

  // Configure audio for background playback
  await setAudioModeAsync({
    playsInSilentMode: true,
    shouldPlayInBackground: true,
    interruptionModeAndroid: 'duckOthers',
    interruptionMode: 'mixWithOthers'
  });

  // Configure audio for recording
  await setAudioModeAsync({
    allowsRecording: true,
    playsInSilentMode: false
  });
  ```

#### setIsAudioActiveAsync (*Function*)
- `setIsAudioActiveAsync(active: boolean): Promise<void>`
  Enables or disables the audio subsystem globally.

  When set to `false`, this will pause all audio playback and prevent new audio from playing.
  This is useful for implementing app-wide audio controls or responding to system events.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `active` | boolean | Whether audio should be active (`true`) or disabled (`false`). |
  Returns: A Promise that resolves when the audio state has been updated.
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { setIsAudioActiveAsync } from 'expo-audio';

  // Disable all audio when app goes to background
  const handleAppStateChange = async (nextAppState) => {
    if (nextAppState === 'background') {
      await setIsAudioActiveAsync(false);
    } else if (nextAppState === 'active') {
      await setIsAudioActiveAsync(true);
    }
  };
  ```

### Event Subscriptions

#### useAudioSampleListener (*Function*)
- `useAudioSampleListener(player: AudioPlayer, listener: (data: AudioSample) => void)`
  Hook that sets up audio sampling for an `AudioPlayer` and calls a listener with audio data.

  This hook enables audio sampling on the player (if supported) and subscribes to audio sample updates.
  Audio sampling provides real-time access to audio waveform data for visualization or analysis.

  > **Note:** Audio sampling requires `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android and is not supported on all platforms.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `player` | AudioPlayer | The `AudioPlayer` instance to sample audio from. |
  | `listener` | (data: AudioSample) => void | Function called with each audio sample containing waveform data. |
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { useAudioPlayer, useAudioSampleListener } from 'expo-audio';

  function AudioVisualizerComponent() {
    const player = useAudioPlayer(require('./music.mp3'));

    useAudioSampleListener(player, (sample) => {
      // Use sample.channels array for audio visualization
      console.log('Audio sample:', sample.channels[0].frames);
    });

    return <AudioWaveform player={player} />;
  }
  ```
